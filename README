Version: 1.25

Description:

  CUMC3D is a parallel code for high-energy astrophysical simulations
  The current version is 1.0, which includes basic MHD solvers and models 
  for simulating accretion discs around supermassive black holes

Version Status:

  HLLC, HLLE, LF Riemann solvers are all available
  3 types of PPM reconstructions, and WENO-Z reconstructions are all available
  Full-3D simulations can now be performed
  Cylindrical coordinates changed to right-handed description

Future Updates:

  HLLD Riemann solvers, Upwind Constrained Transport, Further vectorization of loops
