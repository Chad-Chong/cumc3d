First rotating magnetised white dwarf
On CUMC3D-Ver1.53

Finding ways on calculating Br and Btheta on the face-centered grid
Values exploding at origin and rotational axis

mc suggest: try some analytical method and may perhaps cancelling the 1/rsin(theta) part


/* Currently cannot compile code */
/* Finally need some time dealing with hdf5 (maybe even pgfortran) */

/* Downloaded hdf5 1.14.3 (although 1.14.2 is not using) */


ALL solved
